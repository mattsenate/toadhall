<p>You can use this page to recover files that you saved on the house PC,
even old versions of files that you have overwritten.

<p>The contents of the "Documents" folder on the house PC
are backed up every day.  Daily backups are kept for
five days, weekly backups are kept for five weeks,
and monthly backups are kept for five months.
Each archive only stores files that were modified within
the last six months.</p>

<p>Incremental archives contain files that were
created or changed in the last ten minutes.  Look there first.</p>
