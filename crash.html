<h1>Crash Help</h1>

<p>We have a backup system that backs up everything in the Documents
folder of the study room PC every ten minutes.

<p>Here's what to do if you have lost work on the study room computer.</p>

<ol>
<li>If you were using Word or Excel, start Word or Excel again.
It may open up with your recovered file.</li>

<li>If you were using Word or Excel,
look for AutoSave or AutoRecover files in this directory:
<blockquote><a href="file:D:\Documents\AutoSave"
>D:\Documents\AutoSave</a></blockquote>
Try opening any files you find there (open them from within
Word or Excel).  They may have strange
names, nothing like the original name of your file.  The dates
and sizes on these files can help you identify them.</li>

<li>Look for a recent backup of your file in
<strong><a href="backup.cgi">the backup archives</a></strong>.
The entire contents of the Documents directory are backed up
automatically every day, and the Documents directory is checked
for new files every ten minutes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please <strong>save your work in the Documents folder</strong>.
Saving your work there is safer than saving it in any other
directory, or even on a floppy disk, because a copy will be
automatically saved to the house server within ten minutes.</p>

<p>The archives can help you recover files even if you accidentally
overwrote them or deleted them yourself!  Or, if you've been editing
a paper and you just felt it was better when you saved it
half an hour ago, you can go into the archives and get it back.</p>
