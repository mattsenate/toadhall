Notes on Direct Action
</strong></big>
</table>

<p>These notes are from the direct action training workshop
that took place on Saturday 1 March.

<h3>Defining Direct Action</h3>

<p>Not all direct action is civil disobedience.

<p>Not all direct action is disruptive
(though disruption is in the eye of the beholder).

<h3>Decision-Making</h3>

<p>To help us make decisions on the spot,
when we may be under time pressure or threat of violence:

<ol>
<li>Know our <strong>goals</strong> before we go.

<li>Know our <strong>limits</strong> before we go.
(Each person must know their own constraints.)

<li>Agree on a decision-making <strong>process</strong> before we go.
(Consensus?  Vote?  Follow a leader?)

<li>Prepare <strong>contingency plans</strong> before we go.

<li>Decide whether we will be influenced by what other affinity groups do.
(If they start something else, do we join?)
</ol>

<p>When making decisions:

<ol>
<li><strong>Rumour control</strong> is essential.  Verify sources.

<li>Try breaking into smaller groups.

<li>Try a fishbowl, or a moment of silence.

<li>If under pressure, buy time by moving to a safer place.
</ol>

<h3>Observing</h3>

<p>Take photographs, use video cameras to keep police in line.

<p>All police wear badges; you should be able to see their badge numbers.

<p>Record all badge numbers, license plates,
as much information as possible before conflict starts.

<h3>Police</h3>

<p><strong>Do not touch a police officer.</strong>
Any touching can be considered assaulting a police officer.

<p><strong>Do not grab at police equipment.</strong>
This can also get you in a <em>lot</em> of trouble.

<p>Refuse to converse with police officers.
You do not have to answer their questions.

<p>To detain you, a police officer must be able to <em>explain</em>
why he has reasonable suspicion of your involvement in a crime.

<p>Unless you are arrested, police cannot search you without your consent.
If they try to look through your backpack,
say "No.  I do not consent to a search."

<p>The police will probably give more than one dispersal warning.

<p>The police may threaten to charge you with things.
<em>Police do not charge you</em>; the district attorney does.

<p>To make it harder to pull you away from the group, go limp.
If you are tense, the police have something rigid to grab and pull.

<p>We should ensure that people <em>always have a way out</em>
of arrest, even if they previously said they were arrestable.

<h3>Arrest</h3>

<p>Resisting arrest, blocking the road, failing to disperse,
and trespassing are all misdemeanors.
They cannot stripsearch you for a misdemeanor.

<p>Anything you say can be used against you.
So be careful, or just don't say anything.

<p>If police say you're under arrest and you don't walk with them,
you're resisting arrest.

<p>Police may inflict pain to make you comply.
If you decide to give in, announce "I will go with you" to get them to stop.

<p>If someone is being attacked,
we can "puppy-pile" on them to protect them.
Get their consent ("Can we cover you?").
When others are piling on you, curl up on your side, covering your head.
In a puppy-pile, <strong>keep the heads in the middle</strong>.
Don't expose heads or necks.

<p><strong>The police will lie.</strong>  It's their job.
If no one has recorded evidence,
assume they will claim anything they want.

<h3>After Arrest</h3>

<p>To make it harder to process you, don't give your name.
But <strong>do not use a false name</strong>; that's a serious crime.

<p>Don't ask questions.  It only invites the police to lie.

<p>Don't answer questions.
To make them stop interrogating you, say the magic words:
<strong>"I am going to remain silent.  I want to speak to a lawyer."</strong>

<p>We will have a team of lawyers working all day
to try to see people in jail and help negotiate.

<p>The police may say there are no lawyers.  Don't believe it.
The lawyers will be there, trying to get in.

<p>When in jail, <strong>only believe information from our lawyers</strong>.
