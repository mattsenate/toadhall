To add photos to the Kingman photo album, follow these steps.


1.  Create a new folder on your own computer.  The name of the
    folder should be the date of the event in YYYY-MM-DD format,
    followed by a space, then the title of the event.  For example:

    2003-02-15 Club Kingman Party


2.  Put the picture files in the folder you just created.  (The
    online photo album only accepts JPEG files.)


3.  Now open the shared folder named "photos" on the house server.

  - If you use Windows: open any file explorer window and type
                        "\\guru\photos" into the location bar

  - If you use a Mac: in the Finder, press Command-K and enter
                      "smb://guru/photos" as the address

  - If you use Unix: type "smbclient -U photos //guru/photos"


4.  Drop your folder of pictures into the shared photos folder.


That's it!  Once you've placed pictures here, you can view them at:
