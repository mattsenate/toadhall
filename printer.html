<p>
Since our shiny new printer is able to
<a href="http://10.0.0.2/">give reports on its supplies over the network</a>,
we can have our house server automatically keep records
of our paper and toner usage.
Every day, a new row is added to this chart.
The numbers are reset when a new toner cartridge is installed.
