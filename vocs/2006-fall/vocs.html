<h1>Votes of Confidence</h1>

<div class="deadline">
<strong>PLEASE DO THIS RIGHT NOW!</strong>
</div>

<p>
I apologize for the short notice.

<p>This is the <strong>second of two</strong>
votes of confidence for this semester.
This is Kingman's system of manager evaluation.
The comments you write here will be collected anonymously
and posted for the house to peruse.
If more than 1/3 of the house votes to give a manager
80% of their compensation, a recall vote must be held.

<p>
Please read the "Officers' Duties" in the bylaws on the mail shelf
if you are unsure of what any manager's job entails.
For each manager, <strong>select your choice</strong>
and <strong>write constructive comments</strong> in the space provided.
<p>
(If you're in a hurry, you can just vote for compensation for now
and come back later to add your comments.)
