<h1>Votes of Confidence</h1>

<p>If you prefer, you can also submit your VOC on paper.
Pick one up near the door of room 3H, write your name on it,
and put it in the envelope by room 3H when you're done.
To preserve your anonymity, you can tear off your name,
then put both pieces of paper in the envelope.

<p>You can only vote once,
but you can always come back to this page to add more comments.

<p>This is the <strong>SECOND of TWO</strong>
votes of confidence for this semester.
This is Kingman's system of manager evaluation.
The comments you write here will be collected
and posted <strong>anonymously</strong> for the house to peruse.
If more than 1/3 of the house votes to give a manager
80% of their compensation, a recall vote will be held.
